# Kkweli George - Portfolio

Hey there! I’ve been working on this personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a software developer from the Power Learn Project July 2025 cohort. It’s been a fun process building something that reflects my passion for tech and my growth so far.

## Overview

### Purpose
I wanted a place to highlight my technical expertise and GitHub contributions with a clean, modern design.

### Tech Stack
I built it using plain HTML and CSS, with Font Awesome for icons.

### Design
I opted for a sleek color palette featuring teal as the primary accent, paired with black and gray for a balanced contrast. To add some personality, I included an animated wave background that gently moves, enhancing the visual appeal. I also ensured the layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across devices from mobile phones to desktops.

## Features

### Navigation
There’s a fixed header with a collapsible menu (hamburger icon) on smaller screens (≤768px), complete with a close "X" button. I added smooth transitions to make it feel polished.

### Home
The hero section includes my profile picture, a bold headline ("Kkweli George: Crafting Tomorrow's Tech"), a short intro, and a call-to-action button, all set against a cool wave background.

### About Me
I used a grid layout with a timeline on one side and a bit about myself on the other to show my journey.

### Services
A grid of cards highlights what I offer—Web Development, Automation Solutions, and Software Development.

### Projects
More cards here for my key projects (AfricanCapitals, Avaya, Remote-directory-monitor) with links to GitHub.

### Skills
I displayed my skills (HTML, CSS, Python, C#, PHP, Java, MySQL, JavaScript, Git Bash) with icons that animate on hover.

### Testimonials
Scrolling client testimonials are included, showing feedback from people I’ve worked with.

### Contact
Horizontal buttons let you reach me via GitHub, LinkedIn, email, or download my resume.

### Footer
Keeps it simple with a copyright notice.
