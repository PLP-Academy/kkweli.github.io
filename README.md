# Kkweli George - Portfolio

Hey there! I’ve been working on this personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a software developer from the Power Learn Project July 2025 cohort. It’s been a fun process building something that reflects my passion for tech and my growth so far.

## Overview

### Purpose
I wanted a place to highlight my technical expertise and GitHub contributions with a clean, modern design.

### Tech Stack
I built it using plain HTML and CSS, with Font Awesome for icons to keep it simple yet stylish.

### Design
I opted for a sleek color palette featuring teal as the primary accent, paired with black and gray for a balanced contrast. To add some personality, I included an animated wave background that gently moves, enhancing the visual appeal. I also ensured the layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across devices from mobile phones to desktops.

## Features

### Navigation
There’s a fixed header with a collapsible menu (hamburger icon) on smaller screens (≤768px), complete with a close "X" button. I added smooth transitions to make it feel polished.

### Home
The hero section includes my profile picture, a bold headline ("Kkweli George: Crafting Tomorrow's Tech"), a short intro, and a call-to-action button, all set against a cool wave background.

### About Me
I used a grid layout with a timeline on one side and a bit about myself on the other to show my journey.

### Services
A grid of cards highlights what I offer—Web Development, Automation Solutions, and Software Development.

### Projects
More cards here for my key projects (AfricanCapitals, Avaya, Remote-directory-monitor) with links to GitHub.

### Skills
I displayed my skills (HTML, CSS, Python, C#, PHP, Java, MySQL, JavaScript, Git Bash) with icons that animate on hover.

### Testimonials
Scrolling client testimonials are included, showing feedback from people I’ve worked with.

### Contact
Horizontal buttons let you reach me via GitHub, LinkedIn, email, or download my resume.

### Footer
Keeps it simple with a copyright notice and social links, matching the header’s gradient.

## Notes
I’ve been tinkering with this over the past few days, and it’s coming along nicely as of 07:34 PM SAST on Saturday, August 02, 2025. I added comments to the HTML and CSS to make it easier to maintain, and I’ve formatted this README in Markdown to keep things clear. The animated background and smooth menu transitions are still there—hope you like them! Let me know what you think or if there’s anything else you’d like to see.

## Why `reset.css`?
I included `reset.css` to reset default browser styles (like margins, paddings, and font sizes) to zero. This helps ensure a consistent starting point across browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, avoiding unexpected layout issues and letting my custom styles shine.
