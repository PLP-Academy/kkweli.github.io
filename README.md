Kkweli George - Portfolio
Hey there! I’ve been working on this personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a software developer from the Power Learn Project July 2025 cohort. It’s been a fun process building something that reflects my passion for tech and my growth so far.
Overview

Purpose: I wanted a place to highlight my technical expertise and GitHub contributions with a clean, modern design.
Tech Stack: I built it using plain HTML and CSS, with Font Awesome for icons to keep it simple yet stylish.
Design: I chose a teal, black, and gray theme, added an animated wave background for some flair, and made sure it’s fully responsive across devices.

Features

Navigation: There’s a fixed header with a collapsible menu (hamburger icon) on smaller screens (≤768px), complete with a close "X" button. I added smooth transitions to make it feel polished.
Home: The hero section includes my profile picture, a bold headline ("Kkweli George: Crafting Tomorrow's Tech"), a short intro, and a call-to-action button, all set against a cool wave background.
About Me: I used a grid layout with a timeline on one side and a bit about myself on the other to show my journey.
Services: A grid of cards highlights what I offer—Web Development, Automation Solutions, and Software Development.
Projects: More cards here for my key projects (AfricanCapitals, Avaya, Remote-directory-monitor) with links to GitHub.
Skills: I displayed my skills (HTML, CSS, Python, C#, PHP, Java, MySQL, JavaScript, Git Bash) with icons that animate on hover.
Testimonials: Scrolling client testimonials are included, showing feedback from people I’ve worked with.
Contact: Horizontal buttons let you reach me via GitHub, LinkedIn, email, or download my resume.
Footer: Keeps it simple with a copyright notice and social links, matching the header’s gradient.
